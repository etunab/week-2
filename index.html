    <h1>My College Journey</h1>

    <p>
        College has been an amazing journey for me, filled with learning and personal growth. I have discovered a passion for graphic design and creativity, which has guided my academic path. 
        <i>Studying communication design</i> has opened doors to so many exciting opportunities, including the internship opportunity I'm experiencing right now and has been both challenging and rewarding.

        As I approach graduation, I am excited about the prospect of working in this industry. My goal is to become a creative director for one of my favorite brands, Balenciaga , where I can apply my skills to create innovative designs that haven't been on the fashion market yet.
